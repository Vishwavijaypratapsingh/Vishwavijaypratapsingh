- ⚡ Fun fact: During a river rafting trip in rishikesh, I ended up getting tossed out of the raft by a particularly vigorous rapid. Instead of panicking, I managed to swim to safety and even helped guide the raft back on course from the riverbank. It was an exhilarating experience that taught me a lot about teamwork and staying calm under pressure
